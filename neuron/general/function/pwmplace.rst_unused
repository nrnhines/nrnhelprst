.. function:: pwman_place


    Syntax:
        ``pwman_place(left, top)``

        ``pwman_place(left, top, 0)``


    Description:
        moves the PrintWindowManager to the indicated location in pixel 
        coordinates where 0,0 is the top left corner of the screen. 
        It is intended that if you build an interface by placing windows 
        near the top and build right then the session you save will 
        be portable to other window managers and other systems with 
        different screen sizes. 
         
        If the third argument is 0, then the window is placed but hidden.
